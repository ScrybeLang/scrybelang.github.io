# Numerical Operators

Scrybe supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Additionally, exponentiation is supported, but this should be used sparingly because it currently takes many blocks to do each time with larger exponents, and thus is much more computationally expensive.

<hr>

Here are the symbols for each of these operators:

| Operation                                         | Symbol |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| ![](/assets/operator_add.png) Addition            | `+`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_subtract.png) Subtraction    | `-`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_multiply.png) Multiplication | `*`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_divide.png) Division         | `/`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_mod.png) Modulus             | `%`    |
| Exponentiation                                    | `**`   |
