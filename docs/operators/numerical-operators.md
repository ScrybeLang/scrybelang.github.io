# Numerical Operators

Scrybe supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Exponentiation is also supported, and has been optimized to use as few blocks as possible. However, use this operation sparingly, because it can take many blocks to do each time.

<hr>

Here are the symbols for each of these operators:

| Operation                                         | Symbol |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| ![](/assets/operator_add.png) Addition            | `+`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_subtract.png) Subtraction    | `-`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_multiply.png) Multiplication | `*`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_divide.png) Division         | `/`    |
| ![](/assets/operator_mod.png) Modulus             | `%`    |
| Exponentiation                                    | `**`   |
