# Naming Rules

Despite Scratch's ability to store variable names with any arbitrary unicode character present in their names, Scrybe has a more familiar set of naming rules.

Variable names may contain any letter of the English alphabet, upper- or lowercase. They may also contain digits and underscores, but they cannot start with a digit. For example, these are valid variable names:

```scrybe
my_variable
fibList101
EULERS_CONSTANT
```

while these are not:

```scrybe
15_numbers
digits&letters_list
TWO/THREE
```
