# Functions

Scrybe lets you define functions outside of the builtin ones, allowing you to reuse code in both Scratch and Scrybe. However, Scratch does not support function return values, while Scrybe does. This is a very useful feature that makes functions much more versatile in more languages than this one.

Note that recursive functions are not allowed, as this would require not only implementing a call stack, but also dynamically re-scoping each and every variable defined inside of a function.
