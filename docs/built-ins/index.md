# Built-ins

Scrybe provides many built-in attributes (fields and methods) to make your programming experience more familiar. Many of the blocks in the Scratch pallete are represented by method calls and/or changes to these fields.

<hr>

## [`scratch`](scratch)

The builtin `scratch` provides fields and methods related to the entire project, or events that usually occur outside of the control of a certain target.

## [`C`](c)

The builtin `C` is special, as it simply provides constants that are meant to be used as arguments to built-in methods.

## [`this`](this)

The builtin `this` provides fields and methods related to the current target, with changes to it only affecting the target it's used in.

## [`time`](time)

The builtin `time` provides fields and methods related to timing, including work with the timer.

## [`math`](math)

The builtin `math` provides fields and methods related to mathematical operations, especially those outside of the standard numerical ones natively supported by Scrybe.

## [`random`](random)

The builtin `random` provides several methods related to random number generation and random sampling.
