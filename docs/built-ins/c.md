# `C`

<hr>

This builtin merely contains [aliases](https://github.com/ScrybeLang/Scrybe/blob/35b400b54aa7d01df5f6d6ad27c0a3de4fe1d473/src/scrybe/translations.py#L107) that make calling other builtin methods easier. They are all strings, but are only meant to be used as arguments.

Fields of this builtin are described in other documents.
